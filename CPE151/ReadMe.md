<h1>CpE 151 - CMOS and Digital VLSI Design</h1>

Introduction to CMOS logic gates and the design of CMOS combinational and sequential
functions at the gate level, including CMOS memory. CMOS transistor theory is covered
including: DC equations, threshold voltage, body effect, subthreshold region, channel
length modulation, tunneling, and punch through. A basic exposure to VLSI includes:
CMOS processing technology, layout, and CMOS logic design including power, delay and
timing considerations. Students will use industry standard Computer Aided Design tools
to verify designs and layouts.
