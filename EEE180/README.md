Course Description:
Rigorous development of the fundamental relationships governing time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of linear continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Topics include Fourier, Laplace, and z-transforms, sampling theorem, modulation, system stability, and digital filters.

Prerequisite:
• MATH 45, EEE 117; EEE 117 may be taken concurrently.

Textbook:
Lathi, B. P., Signal Processing and Linear Systems, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.
Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, you can
• find the output of a linear, time-invariant, continuous-time system for a given input and initial conditions.
• find the output of a linear, time-invariant, discrete-time system for a given input and initial conditions.
• design a realization of a linear, time-invariant, continuous-time system having a desired system transfer function.
• design a realization of a linear, time-invariant, discrete-time system having a desired system transfer function.
• determine the effect on a signal’s frequency spectrum of passing the signal through a linear, time-invariant, continuous-time system
