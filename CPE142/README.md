# CPE 142 - Advanced Computer Organization

In this course we learn how a processor actually works. You already know what software code is, how to write code, and what logic circuits are, and how to design them to do simple functions. But what is involved in designing a logic circuit that can execute any piece of software? Welcome to the magical world of computer architecture and organization.  

Warning: This course is assignment heavy (weekly), which requires experimenting with sometimes open-ended solutions that are new and  could be flawed (not repeats of prior semester assignments). Account for this in your time budgeting when selecting this course. Participating in assignment discussion is essential to getting a full grade. Additionally there are mid-class quizzes.

NOTE: You must work on your assignments yourself. That is the only way you will grasp what is going on at the heart of processor. A computer Engineer or Scientist needs to fully understand these concepts. Students that submit copies of other student's submissions will not get a good grade. Because of the open-endedness of assignments (especially the later ones) if you copy solutions it will be obvious, even if wires are shuffled around.

Grading

Grading will roughly be 70% assignments, 15% mid-class quizzes and 15% final exam. 

Catalog Description: Design and performance issues of computers.  Topics include instruction set architecture, computer arithmetic, processor design, survey of contemporary architectures, interfacing I/O devices, hierarchical memory design and analysis, parallelism and multiprocessing, distributed systems, techniques for enhancing performance. Students will design and simulate a microprocessor in a logic simulator, and later convert it into Verilog high-level description language. Cross-listed as CpE 142, and can be taken only once for credit. 

Prerequisites: CSc 137, or CpE 166 and CpE 185.

Course Outcomes: Students completing this course will be able to

    Evaluate the performance of a computer system;
    Describe results of a technical project results in a grammatically correct report;
    In a team environment, design and simulate a microcomputer based on a given instruction set and analyze its performance;
    Design and analyze the central components of a microcomputer;

Student Outcomes: This course contributes to the following student outcomes. Graduates should be able to

    Understand the critical concepts in processor design.
    Analyze a complex processor designs and apply principles of computing to identify solutions;
    Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the programâ€™s discipline;
    Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions;
